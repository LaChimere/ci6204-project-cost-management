## PPT 思路

1. Objectives

   * To propose the reasons behind the cost underestimation by looking into the past project through a qualitative perspective in the preparation phase of cost estimation.
   * To demonstrate the reasons above based on the study and analysis of McDonald's Innovate case.

2. Literature Review

     Cost estimation is directly connected with the performance and effectiveness of a software project development because overestimation can result in failure of project development while underestimation may lead to financial losses.

     Intuitive cost estimation is one of the qualitative cost estimation techniques, which is based on using the past experience. By looking into the experience of a past project, we may have a basic knowledge about a new project.

     According to the goal of the checklist that is listed in Magne Jørgensen's paper, aiming to increase the cost estimation accuracy, ensure that work is completed within the approved cost budget and enable more efficient use of estimation resources, the structure of software cost management process framework consisting four phases below:

     * Preparation Phase
     * Estimation Phase
     * Application Phase
     * Learning Phase

     The question – what are the prerequisites for estimating – makes software estimation so difficult when confronting the problems such as difficulties to control the development of software.

     Three different reasons are suggested: bad luck, over-optimism, and deliberate underestimation. Project  management can usually point to project difficulty and complexity, technical uncertainty, stakeholder conflicts,  scope changes, unforeseen events, and other not really unpredictable bad luck.
