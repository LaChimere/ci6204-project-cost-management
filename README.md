## PPT 思路

1. Objectives

   根据 Conclusion，Objectives 是通过 chapter 8 这样的一个失败案例，分析它所运用到的定性估算方法，并结合相对成功的 case 说明要较好地运用这些方法应当做到什么，最终总结出项目初期对 cost 做定性估算时，应该考虑/综合哪些因素能够得到更好的效果。

2. Literature Review

   这一部分放 [literature-review.md](assignments/literature-review.md) 里面定性方法就行，这部分我来负责。

   > 1. **Intuitive Cost Estimation Techniques**
   >
   >    based on using the past experience.
   >
   >    * Case-Based Methodology
   >
   >      known as case-based reasoning (CBR) attempts to make use of the info contained in previous design cases by adapting a past design from a database that closely matches the attributes of a new design.
   >
   >    * Design Support Systems (DSS)
   >
   >      to assist estimators in making better judgments and decisions at different levels of the estimation process by making use of the stored knowledge of experts in the field.
   >
   >      * Rule-Based Systems
   >
   >        based on process time and cost calculation of feasible processes from a set of available ones for the manufacture of a part based on design and/or manufacturing constraints.
   >
   >        helps to design and manufacturing constraints.
   >
   >      * Fuzzy-Logic Approach
   >
   >        particularly helpful in handling uncertainty, may be quite tedious and need further research when objects are complex.
   >
   > 2. **Analogical Cost Estimation Techniques**
   >
   >    employ similarity criteria based on historical cost data for products with known cost.
   >
   >    * Regression Analysis Models
   >
   >      make use of the historical cost data to establish a linear relationship between the product costs for the past design cases and the values of certain selected variables so that the relationship can be used to forecast the cost of a new product. (*e.g.* linear relationships between the final product cost and the cost factors)
   >
   >    * Back-Propagation Neural-Network (BPNN) Models
   >
   >      use a neural network (NN) trained from past data to answer to questions that may not have been seen before.
   >
   >      particularly useful in uncertain conditions and adaptable to deal with nonlinearity issues.

3. Case Study

   按照 chapter 8 来找它涉及到上面 Literature Review 的方法，谈一谈它是怎么运用所涉及到的方法进行分析的（通过文章、章末文献和其他涉及到这个 case 的资料来描述就可）。

4. Analysis

   对于 chapter 8 中所涉及到的方法，一起找其他用到这些方法的 case，分析清楚它们比 chapter 8 做得好的地方在哪里（多考虑了什么样的因素，有什么依据），为什么做得好。

5. Conclusion

   总结一下定性估算方法的重要性；总结项目初期做好定性估算应当考虑哪些因素，根据什么依据。
