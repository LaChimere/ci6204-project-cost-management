  *Good cost estimation has a direct bearing on the performance and effectiveness of a business enterprise because overestimation can result in loss of business and goodwill in the market, whereas underestimation may lead toward financial losses to the enterprise.*

  **Cost estimation is directly connected with the performance and effectiveness of a software project development because overestimation can result in failure of project development while underestimation may lead to financial losses.**

  *Qualitative cost estimation techniques are primarily based on a comparison analysis of a new product with the products that have been manufactured previously in order to identify the similarities in the new one. The identified similarities help to incorporate the past data into the new product so that the need to obtain the cost estimate from scratch is greatly reduced.*

  **Qualitative cost estimation methods are mainly based on a comparison analysis of a new software project  with the previous projects with the similarities in the new one that can help to incorporate the past data to reduce the need to obtain the cost estimation from scratch.**

  **Qualitative cost estimation techniques can be categorized into intuitive and analogical techniques.**

  **The intuitive cost estimation techniques are based on using the past experience.**

  **One of the intuitive cost estimation techniques is case-based methodology, which is known as case-based reasoning (CBR) attempts to make use of the information contained in previous design cases by adapting a past design from a database that closely matches the attributes of a new design.**

  **Next one is decision support systems (DSS), the main purpose of which is to assist estimators in making better judgments and decisions at different levels of the estimation process by making use of the stored knowledge of experts in the field.**

  *Rule-Based Systems. These systems are based on process time and cost calculation of feasible processes from a set of available ones for the manufacture of a part based on design and/or manufacturing constraints. Such a system reflects these constraints in a respective rule class with the information encapsulated in it by an expert in the area. A rule-based algorithm is an example of one such approach that helps to establish design and manufacturing constraints.*

  *Fuzzy-Logic Approach. This approach to cost estimation is particularly helpful in handling uncertainty.*

  *Expert Systems. This approach is based on storing the knowledge in a database and manipulating it on demand to infer quicker, more consistent, and more accurate results based on an attempt to mimic the human expert thought process with the help of an automated logical reasoning approach, normally achieved by rule-based programing.*

  *During the early phases of the design cycle, when limited data are available, qualitative cost estimation techniques are more appropriate and provide a helpful starting point for a detailed analysis at a later stage.*

  *Qualitative techniques, therefore, are helpful either in furnishing rough cost estimates or serve as a decision-aid tool for designers or estimators especially during the early phases of design process.*

  *INTUITIVE AND ANALOGICAL METHODS: EARLY DESIGN STAGES*

  *In response to limitations of traditional statistical techniques and to improve their performance in terms of accuracy and consistency, new techniques including the non-linear machine learning method of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the problem-solving and learning method of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), heuristic optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), and probability distribution optimization methods like Monte Carlo, and decision trees were introduced.*

  *Two of the most frequently studied cost estimation methods for early design stages are ANN and CBR. The major advantages reported for ANN models are that they do not require the project cost to be defined as a specific function of cost-affecting variables. Also many studies in both construction and manufacturing have shown their higher accuracy compared to traditional regression models (Bode 2000; Kim et al. 2004; Cavalieri et al. 2004). Major advantages of CBR models are transparency of the process which turns it into a suitable decision support tool, the ability to handle missing attribute information from previous cases and the feasibility of long-term use due to ease of updating models through the addition of new cases (Arditi & Tokdemir 1999; Cavalieri et al. 2004)*

  *The goal of these methods is to predict project costs with limited information provided in early stages of a project with an acceptable accuracy rate. These cost predictions are generally used by project owners for feasibility studies and budgeting purposes.*
