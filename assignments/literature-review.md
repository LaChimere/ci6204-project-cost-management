  *Good cost estimation has a direct bearing on the performance and effectiveness of a business enterprise because overestimation can result in loss of business and goodwill in the market, whereas underestimation may lead toward financial losses to the enterprise.*

  **Cost estimation is directly connected with the performance and effectiveness of a software project development because overestimation can result in failure of project development while underestimation may lead to financial losses.**

  *Qualitative cost estimation techniques are primarily based on a comparison analysis of a new product with the products that have been manufactured previously in order to identify the similarities in the new one. The identified similarities help to incorporate the past data into the new product so that the need to obtain the cost estimate from scratch is greatly reduced.*

  **Qualitative cost estimation methods are mainly based on a comparison analysis of a new software project  with the previous projects with the similarities in the new one that can help to incorporate the past data to reduce the need to obtain the cost estimation from scratch.**

  **Qualitative cost estimation techniques can be categorized into intuitive and analogical techniques.**

  

  1. **Intuitive Cost Estimation Techniques**

     based on using the past experience.

     * Case-Based Methodology

       known as case-based reasoning (CBR) attempts to make use of the info contained in previous design cases by adapting a past design from a database that closely matches the attributes of a new design.

     * Design Support Systems (DSS)

       to assist estimators in making better judgments and decisions at different levels of the estimation process by making use of the stored knowledge of experts in the field.

       * Rule-Based Systems

         based on process time and cost calculation of feasible processes from a set of available ones for the manufacture of a part based on design and/or manufacturing constraints.

         helps to design and manufacturing constraints.

       * Fuzzy-Logic Approach

         particularly helpful in handling uncertainty, may be quite tedious and need further research when objects are complex.

  2. **Analogical Cost Estimation Techniques**

     employ similarity criteria based on historical cost data for products with known cost.

     * Regression Analysis Models

       make use of the historical cost data to establish a linear relationship between the product costs for the past design cases and the values of certain selected variables so that the relationship can be used to forecast the cost of a new product. (*e.g.* linear relationships between the final product cost and the cost factors)

     * Back-Propagation Neural-Network (BPNN) Models

       use a neural network (NN) trained from past data to answer to questions that may not have been seen before.

       particularly useful in uncertain conditions and adaptable to deal with nonlinearity issues.

  3. Parametric Cost Estimation Techniques (Quantitative)

     by applying the statistical methodologies, by expressing cost as a function of its constituent variables.

     helpful when the parameters could be easily identified.

  4. Analytical Cost Estimation Techniques (Quantitative)

  

  Qualitative techniques are generally favorable in making cost estimates in the early design stages because these techniques make use of the past data to predict the cost of anew product without requiring detailed information. Although, the accuracy of these techniques is sometimes questionable, the rough estimates obtained in the early design phases still provide a good platform for decision making, which is employed during all the stages of the design and development process. Thus, product cost can be controlled from the conceptual design stages when the design alternatives have a direct bearing on the product cost to the shop floor execution stages when the process alternatives are the results of the choices made during the early phases of the design process.

  *INTUITIVE AND ANALOGICAL METHODS: EARLY DESIGN STAGES*

  *In response to limitations of traditional statistical techniques and to improve their performance in terms of accuracy and consistency, new techniques including the non-linear machine learning method of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), the problem-solving and learning method of Case-Based Reasoning (CBR), heuristic optimization algorithms like Genetic Algorithm (GA), and probability distribution optimization methods like Monte Carlo, and decision trees were introduced.*

  *Two of the most frequently studied cost estimation methods for early design stages are ANN and CBR. The major advantages reported for ANN models are that they do not require the project cost to be defined as a specific function of cost-affecting variables. Also many studies in both construction and manufacturing have shown their higher accuracy compared to traditional regression models (Bode 2000; Kim et al. 2004; Cavalieri et al. 2004). Major advantages of CBR models are transparency of the process which turns it into a suitable decision support tool, the ability to handle missing attribute information from previous cases and the feasibility of long-term use due to ease of updating models through the addition of new cases (Arditi & Tokdemir 1999; Cavalieri et al. 2004)*

  *The goal of these methods is to predict project costs with limited information provided in early stages of a project with an acceptable accuracy rate. These cost predictions are generally used by project owners for feasibility studies and budgeting purposes.*
