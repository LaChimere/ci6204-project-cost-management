  Cost estimation is directly connected with the performance and effectiveness of a software project development because overestimation can result in failure of project development while underestimation may lead to financial losses.

  Intuitive cost estimation is one of the qualitative cost estimation techniques, which is based on using the past experience. By looking into the experience of a past project, we may have a basic knowledge about a new project.

  According to the goal of the checklist that is listed in Magne JÃ¸rgensen's paper, aiming to increase the cost estimation accuracy, aiming to increase the cost estimation accuracy, ensure that work is completed within the approved cost budget and enable more efficient use of estimation resources, the structure of software cost management process framework consisting four phases below:

  * Preparation Phase
  * Estimation Phase
  * Application Phase
  * Learning Phase
