## Analysis

### Cost: Little fiscal prudence

When the **post-9/11** national sentiment to fight terrorism went into an overdrive, it was **easy to** see why the Congress, in the name of homeland security, provided **funds liberally to the FBI**. Flushed with **seemingly inexhaustible financial resources** in its war chest to build the VCF, **the FBI had little incentive to exercise fiscal prudence throughout the project**.

**Each time the funds were running low, all the FBI had to do was to ask for more.** Perhaps, the high importance and urgency of the project had muted the voices of critics among those holding the purse-string in the Congress. Money continued to be poured into the VCF even though the signs of the project were hardly propitious.

The FBI **could have cut its losses and aborted the project**, especially when the VCF was found to be plagued with several functional deficiencies. Yet, it was apparently **too anxious to show some quick results**. Instead of committing upfront to another US\$16.4 million on the IOC, it could have at least waited for the report from the independent reviewer Aerospace Corporation, who was further paid US\$2 million.
