## Analysis

### Cost: Little fiscal prudence

When the **<u>post-9/11</u>** national sentiment to fight terrorism went into an overdrive, it was **<u>easy to</u>** see why the Congress, in the name of homeland security, provided **<u>funds liberally to the FBI</u>**. Flushed with **<u>seemingly inexhaustible financial resources</u>** in its war chest to build the VCF, **<u>the FBI had little incentive to exercise fiscal prudence throughout the project</u>**.

**<u>Each time the funds were running low, all the FBI had to do was to ask for more.</u>** Perhaps, the high importance and urgency of the project had muted the voices of critics among those holding the purse-string in the Congress. Money continued to be poured into the VCF even though the signs of the project were hardly propitious.

The FBI **<u>could have cut its losses and aborted the project</u>**, especially when the VCF was found to be plagued with several functional deficiencies. Yet, it was apparently **<u>too anxious to show some quick results</u>**. Instead of committing upfront to another US\$16.4 million on the IOC, it could have at least waited for the report from the independent reviewer Aerospace Corporation, who was further paid US\$2 million.
